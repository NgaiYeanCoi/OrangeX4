- A passionate supporter of VS Code, considering it the most suitable IDE for myself and believing that "VS Code is a way of life." üìù
- Also a supporter of Typst and its ecosystem, currently trying to use Typst as a replacement for Markdown and LaTeX. ‚úçüèª
- Therefore, I am a fan of "visible technology," such as "typesetting," "computer graphics," and "human-computer interaction." üñ•Ô∏è
